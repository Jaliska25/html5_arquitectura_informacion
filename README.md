# 🏗️ HTML5 Project

Hey! 👋  
This is a project from the Cybersecurity Master’s Program where I built a complete web app **using only HTML5**.  

The main goal was to focus on **information architecture** — structuring and organizing content clearly using only HTML. 

That said, I ended up adding a tiny bit of inline CSS directly into the HTML. At that point, I didn’t really know CSS yet, but the raw page looked so visually off that I added a few basic styles — even if I wasn’t totally sure what I was doing. 😅

Thanks for checking it out!😉
